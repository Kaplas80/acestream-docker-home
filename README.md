# Dockerized Acestream

[Leer documentación en Español](README_es.md)

This project makes it easier to deploy Acestream within a Docker container, based on Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) to ensure compatibility with the Acestream version used.

Acestream is a popular platform for live streaming, enabling users to share and watch video content through peer-to-peer networks. Using Acestream within a Docker container offers an efficient and isolated way to run Acestream, making its installation and configuration more straightforward.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you need to have Docker installed and running on your machine. This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of Docker containers and the Docker ecosystem.

To install Docker, follow the instructions on the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) or visit the [Docker products page](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) to download the appropriate version for your operating system.

To ensure that Docker is correctly installed and ready for use, execute:

```bash
docker --version
```

## Automatic Installation and Execution with `SetupAcestream.bat` Script (Windows)

We have provided a `.bat` script named `SetupAcestream.bat` to simplify the entire process of installing, configuring, and running Acestream in Docker containers for Windows users. The script automates several steps, including:

1. Verification and installation of Docker if necessary.
2. Automatic configuration of the `acestream://` protocol on Windows.
3. Downloading the latest Docker image of `smarquezp/docker-acestream-ubuntu-home` from Docker Hub.
4. Running the container, exposing port 6878, which allows access to the Acestream service from any device within your local network.

### How to Use the `SetupAcestream.bat` Script

To use this script, simply download the [SetupAcestream.bat](https://github.com/marquezpsergio/acestream-docker/releases) file and run it. This script prepares everything necessary to run Acestream in Docker and automatically opens the web interface where you can directly load Acestream links without needing to pass them as arguments.

Remember to run the file as an Administrator to configure the records for the Acestream protocol. This associates all 'acestream://' links with this script, automating the process of opening Acestream links.

> **Note:** This process ensures that you are always using the latest version of the Acestream Docker image and allows you to manage the container efficiently.

## Building the Image

This project uses the **ubuntu:bionic** base image and is compatible with the Acestream version _acestream_3.1.74_ubuntu_18.04_x86_64.tar.gz_.

To build your own Docker image from this Dockerfile, execute the following command in the terminal, ensuring you are in the same directory as the Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build --no-cache -t docker-acestream-ubuntu-home .
```

If you need to use a different version of Acestream and its SHA256 hash, you can specify them when building the image with the following arguments:

```bash
docker build --no-cache --build-arg ACESTREAM_VERSION=your_acestream_version --build-arg ACESTREAM_SHA256=your_sha256_hash -t docker-acestream-ubuntu-home .
```

## Running the Container

With the Docker image built, you can start a container to run Acestream in the following way:

```bash
docker run --name acestream -d -p 6878:6878 --restart unless-stopped docker-acestream-ubuntu-home
```

This command will run a container named `acestream`, in detached mode (`-d`), mapping the host's port `6878` to the container, allowing you to access the Acestream service through this port.

## Running the Container via Docker Compose

Download or copy the contents of ``docker-compose.yml`` file.

Then, on the same place where it is located:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Updating with Docker Compose

Execute:

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

## Accessing the Web Interface

Once the container is running and there are no errors in the logs, you can access the Acestream web interface using a web browser and going to `http://localhost:6878/webui/player/`. Here, you can directly load Acestream links into the field located in the upper left corner of the screen. When you wish, you can hide/show it with the icon to its left.

## Verifying Container Health

You can check the health status of the container with the following command:

```bash
docker inspect --format='{{json .State.Health}}' acestream
```

The health status can also be seen from the web interface deployed through the link: `http://localhost:6878/webui/api/service?method=get_version`
